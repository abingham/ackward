The ackward documentation relies on two systems:

  * doxygen, for extracting C++ documentation
  * sphinx, for overall organization and presentation

We use the 'breathe' sphinx extension to bridge the two worlds.

Here are the steps for creating the documentation:

 1. Do a complete build.  

    This is needed to make sure that all of the headers have been
    generated from source.

 2. In the ``docs/doxygen`` directory, run ``doxygen``.

    This will parse the C++ source and extract the embedded
    documentation.

 3. In the ``docs/sphinx/source`` directory, run ``make html``.

    This will generate the final documentation from the
    restructured-text source. This phase imports data generated in the
    doxygen step.

That's it. Your output will be in the
``docs/sphinx/source/_build/html`` directory.

Here's the short version::

  % cd <location of ackward SConsctruct>
  % scons
  % cd docs/doxygen
  % doxygen
  % cd ../sphinx/source
  % make html
