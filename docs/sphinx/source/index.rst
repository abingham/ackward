ackward: A C++ interface to Python's standard library
=====================================================

ackward provides a C++ interface to some of the standard Python
modules. This was initially started to make Python's ``logging`` module
more accessible from C++ programs which embed Python. It could (and
should) be expanded to include any modules which might be useful from
a C++ program.
