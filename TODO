* Debugging issue sefault with unit-tests.

  Break in ackward::queue::module(). Let 'mod' get assigned. 'pyo mod'
  will print something that looks suspicious...refcount 0 bytes
  object. 'pyo mod.m_ptr' will print what you expect, the queue
  module. Then do 'pyo mod' again, and you'll get a segfault. Hmmm...
