This project provides a C++ interface to some of the standard Python modules. This was initially started to make Python's 'logging' module more accessible from C++ programs which embed Python. It could (and should) be expanded to include any modules which might be useful from a C++ program.

**ackward is a young project.** It still has room for all manner of input and development. Some of the areas where it could use work include:

  * Support for more platforms (currently just linux.)
  * Support for python 3.
  * More package coverage.
  * A more polished infrastructure layer.
